> *Time is a loan you cannot afford.*

A puzzle-adventure game where the player can borrow time from the future to solve the present — but every second borrowed must be repaid later with interest.

## 🎮 Concept

**TEMPORAL DEBT** subverts the typical time-manipulation power fantasy. Instead of giving players godlike control over time, it treats time freezing as a Faustian bargain — powerful but costly.

### Core Mechanics

- **Time Freeze (SPACE)**: Hold to freeze time. You can move and plan while the world is stopped.
- **Temporal Debt**: Every second frozen accrues 1.5 seconds of debt.
- **Debt Repayment**: When time resumes, the world accelerates until your debt is repaid.
- **Debt Tiers**: Higher debt means faster world spee d, creating escalating difficulty.
- **Temporal Bankruptcy**: Exceed 20 seconds of debt and face extreme consequences.

### Unique Systems

| System | Descriptios |
|--------|-------------|
| **Temporal Echoes** | When frozen, see where enemies will be in the future |
| **Time Anchors** | Place up to 3 save points, recall at the cost of debt |
| **Debt Sinks** | Crystals that absorb debt (limi ted uses) |
| **Temporal Hunters** | Enemies that only move when time is frozen |
| **Debt Shadows** | Manifestations of high debt that chase you |

## ✨ V2.0 NEW FEATURES

### 🚀 Temporal Momentum
**Stay in motion, reduce your debt!**
- Build momentum by avoiding time freezes
- Up to 10x momentum multiplier
- Reduces debt accumulation rate by 5% per point
- Visual momentum meter on HUD

### ⏱️ Time Dilation Zones
**Strategic areas that alter debt physics**
- **Safe Zones (Blue)**: 0.75x debt rate - provides breathing room
- **Danger Zones (Red)**: 2x debt rate - high risk shortcuts
- Visual indicators show active effects

### 💎 Temporal Fragments
**Collectible time crystals with powerful effects**
- Scattered throughout levels
- Each fragment provides 1.5s debt reduction
- Collect 5 fragments for **Slow-Motion Burst** ability
- Emit particles and glow when nearby

### 👤 Chrono-Clone System
**Spawn temporal duplicates of yourself!**
- Records last 5 seconds of movement
- Press **C** to spawn a clone that replays your path
- Clones can distract enemies and trigger pressure plates
- 8 second cooldown between spawns

### 🌊 Resonance Events
**Periodic time waves create timing challenges**
- Waves occur every 15-20 seconds
- +3 second penalty if frozen during wave
- -0.5 second bonus if moving during wave
- Visual warning before each wave

### 📦 Debt Transfer Pods
**Store your debt for later... or for enemies!**
- Hold **F** to deposit debt into pods
- Can store up to 5 seconds of debt
- Strategic placement for puzzle solutions
- Release debt strategically

### ⏪ Time Reversal
**Limited rewind ability for critical moments**
- Press **R** to rewind 3 seconds
- Costs 8 seconds of debt
- 1 use per life - use wisely!
- Restores position, velocity, and debt

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

### Time as Consequence
Unlike other time-manipulation games, freezing time in TEMPORAL DEBT isn't free. This creates:
- **Strategic depth**: When to freeze? For how long?
- **Tension**: Debt creates anxiety and urgency
- **Mastery expression**: Expert players minimize debt

### The Debt Spiral
High debt → faster world → harder gameplay → need to freeze → more debt

This feedback loop is intentional. It rewards restraint and punishes spam.

### Economic Metaphor
The debt system mirrors real-world lending:
- **Interest compounds** at higher tiers
- **Bankruptcy** has severe consequences
- **Debt sinks** are limited resourses

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- **Clean Architecture**: Modular, well-documented codebase
- **Event System**: Decoupled communication between systems
- **Time Engine**: Sophisticated time scaling and freeze mechanics
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Efficient collision detection
- **State Machine**: Clean game state management

## 🚀 Future Development Ideas

- **Story Mode**: Narrative explaining the Temporal Borrower's origin
- **Endless Mode**: Procedurally generated rooms with escalating difficulty
- **Multiplayer**: Shared debt between players
- **Boss Encounters**: Debt Lords as challenging boss battles
- **Audio**: Dynamic music that responds to debt level
- **Level Editor**: Create and share custom levels

## 📊 V2.0 Technical Additions

- **Momentum System**: Rewards continuous movement with debt reduction
- **Resonance System**: Periodic time waves with state machine design
- **Clone System**: Movement recording and playback with interpolation
- **Reversal System**: Game state snapshot and restoration
- **Fragment Manager**: Collectible system with burst ability
- **Enhanced HUD**: Real-time V2 system status display
